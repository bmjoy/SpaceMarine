# SpaceMarine and why I made it.

The repository contains the game ilustrated by the video below, the assets are free and come from (PixelGameArt)[http://pixelgameart.org/web/]:

My main goal when I first started this game was to make a 2d-platformer with a decent code architecture, which I would be able to reuse code in the future or extend to a "real project". 

By no means I wanna say every real project has to have a perfect architecture or be completely extendable, I believe every project has its own purpose in life and by the time I started this one I wanted to make it with code that is maintainable, manageable, clean, applying some (design patterns)[https://github.com/ycarowr/Unity-Design-Pattern] and trying to respect the (SOLID)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID] principles of (OOP)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming]. 
However, as I progressed with it overtime, I've found more things to do in my life and I believe I couldn't really keep the same excitement as I had on the beginning. Here you can also count the fact that, this is a project done in a few months during my free time at the weekends or early mornings/evenings after work 8h with no hopes to make money with it.

## Game's Architecture:

Since there are a few things to cover I split it into four parts which I will talk separately:
1. The Scenes of the game;
2. The [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) of the game;
3. The entity system: player, enemies, doors, bullets and the game mechanics;
4. The initialization of the systems;
5. [Submodule](https://github.com/ycarowr/Tools) with Tools to speed up the implementation and make every thing more generic.


### Scenes
The game is separated in two different [scenes](https://github.com/ycarowr/SpaceMarine/tree/master/Assets/Scenes) that work idenpendenly: 
  1. __Opening__ - It contains a short introduction of the game, displaying a cut scene with a background, a spacecraft and text dialogs that receives input to go ahead and write the next piece of text. The scene ends with a dark screen fade which makes transition to the playable game. The scene is mostly driven by the script [OpenSceneSequence](https://github.com/ycarowr/SpaceMarine/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Data/Sequences/Opening/OpeningSceneSequence.cs), which contains the instructions to move the spacecraft and show the text dialog.
  2. __Game__ - Contains the playable part of the game: monsters, player, doors, rooms and elevator are all here. 
  
### The MVC and Communication between Model and View

I won't be able to get into what is a [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) here, there is a ton of content regarding this subject online, it for sure won't be difficult to find information.
  
The [Model](https://github.com/ycarowr/SpaceMarine/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/Model) and [UI/View](https://github.com/ycarowr/SpaceMarine/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/Ui) communication is done using the following [interfaces/Events](https://github.com/ycarowr/SpaceMarine/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/GameEvents/GameEvent.cs) and the [Observer Pattern](https://github.com/ycarowr/Tools/blob/3be2788408fd80bcd3c4a849bb0a7161230d944a/Patterns/Observer/Observer.cs) which allows to remove the (coupling)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)] between these layers of the application. In shorter words, the UI scripts implement an interface and subscribe the events they are interested into, the Model classes dispatch those events when they happen.

As the [Observer](https://github.com/ycarowr/Tools/blob/3be2788408fd80bcd3c4a849bb0a7161230d944a/Patterns/Observer/Observer.cs) code shows, once a listener subscribes the event register, all its events/interfaces are now ready to be notified by the game model.

Quick examples: 

1. Most of the simple elements of the UI inherit from [UiGameEventListener](https://github.com/ycarowr/Tools/blob/3be2788408fd80bcd3c4a849bb0a7161230d944a/Patterns/GameEvents/UiGameEventListener.cs) and are attached to the observer after the _Start()_ engine callback. However, more complex entities that have their own base class perform their own subscription, such as [UiRoom](https://github.com/ycarowr/SpaceMarine/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Ui/Entities/Rooms/UiRoom.cs). 

2. At the bottom of the class [Door](https://github.com/ycarowr/SpaceMarine/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Model/Mechanics/Door.cs) we have an example of the model code notifying the events that handle the door damage and destruction, _OnTakeDamage()_ and _Destroy()_ methods respectively.
